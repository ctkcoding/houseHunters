README/Introduction To House Hunters

Basic Gameplay:
The basis of this game is navigating around a house that you awake in. You will move from room to room completing your objectives.

Monsters:
There are monsters moving randomly around the house, who will attack you when sharing a room. If you are in a room with them before you move, you will be given the opportunity to leave the room as if running from them. If you move into a room that has one, then you will be required to fight. Monster movements are different each time the game is played, so do not try to predict or memorize them.

Items/Weapons:
Additionally, there are items you can pick up. Most are weapons that can be used in fights against the monsters. When you have multiple weapons, you will use the weapon that is most powerful to fight against the monster.
Other items, such as keys, may be used to open locked rooms, or may be completely useless and be nothing more than dead weight.

Fighting:
When you fight a monster, you will not be prompted with any options. Your odds are generated, and the fight occurs at lightning speed, as it would in real life. You will only know if you won the fight, and killed the monster, or if you lost the fight, and are now dead and being eaten.

Input:
Every round when it is your turn, information about your surroundings will be given to you. This includes the name of your current room, a description of the current room, and a list of the exits from the room and where they lead to. You will also be told if anyone else (monster or human) is in the room with you, if there are any objects you can pick up, and if there are any monsters in rooms directly adjacent to yours. All commands must be entered in lowercase, followed by a return. Invalid inputs will be ignored and require you to re-enter your command.

Then you will be prompted to make a choice. You have a few options:
1)move. this lets you move to a room adjacent to yours by typing in the direction of the room you would like to move to (ie “move” RETURN “north”)

2)take. if there is an object in the room that you can take with you, this will let you pick up the item (ie “take” RETURN “pistol”)

3)help. this will bring up a prompt reminding you of the game parameters/instructions. you will be able to make another move after this (ie “help” RETURN)

4)pockets. this will bring up a list of the items in your pockets. you will be able to make another move after this (ie “pockets” RETURN)

4)wait. this will keep you in the same room if you do not wish to move from your room. other players will be given their turns before you move again (ie “wait” RETURN)

5)quit. this will end the game. (ie “quit” RETURN)

Goal:
Your goal is to kill all the monsters and get the rifle that is stored in the bedroom. When you have done these things, the house will be secure and you will be safe.
